## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please:

1. **Read the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the [README.md](README.md), [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md), and other documentation
2. **Check Existing Issues**: Look through [open issues](https://github.com/bancey/document-smbrelay-service/issues) to see if your concern is already being addressed
3. **Join Discussions**: Participate in issue discussions to understand the project's direction

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21 or higher** (Go 1.22+ recommended)
- **smbclient binary** (from Samba package)
- **Git** for version control
- **Make** (optional, for using Makefile commands)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

./bin/server
# or
make run
```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue using the **Bug Report** template. Include:

- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (Go version, OS, etc.)
- Relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Features

For feature requests, use the **Feature Request** template. Include:

- Clear description of the proposed feature
- Use case and motivation
- Potential implementation approach (if applicable)
- Any alternatives you've considered

### Contributing Code

1. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   make test
   go fmt ./...
   go vet ./...
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve specific bug"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

- **Format code** with `go fmt` before committing:
  ```bash
  go fmt ./...
  # or
  make fmt
  ```

- **Run static analysis** with `go vet`:
  ```bash
  go vet ./...
  # or
  make vet
  ```

- **Follow Go best practices**:
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Keep functions focused and concise
  - Add comments for exported functions and types
  - Handle errors appropriately
  - Use Go idioms and standard patterns

### Code Organization

- Place business logic in the `internal/` directory
- Keep handlers thin; move complex logic to appropriate packages
- Maintain separation of concerns (config, handlers, SMB operations, etc.)
- Follow the existing project structure

### Error Handling

- Always check and handle errors
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use structured logging for debugging
- Don't panic in production code

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run tests with race detection
make test-race

# Run tests in verbose mode
make test-verbose
```

### Writing Tests

- **Write unit tests** for new functionality
- **Follow existing test patterns** in the codebase
- **Use table-driven tests** where appropriate
- **Mock external dependencies** (SMB connections, file systems)
- **Test edge cases and error conditions**
- **Aim for high test coverage** for critical paths

### Test Structure

```go
func TestFeatureName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test implementation
        })
    }
}
```
